## FAQ

#### Q: Why did you make this website?

A: Because I wanted a personal site to list stuff about myself. This makes it easier to communicate with people who need to know more about me; and it is good in general to have a personal site.

#### Q: Should I make my own website?

A: Absolutely! I encourage everyone to make their own website. There are a lot of reasons why you should do so. It gives you better job opportunities, helps in communicating with people, etc.

#### Q: Where did you get the theme from?

A: I "borrowed" the theme from my fellow friend shadow_aya. I made a lot of tweaks, but the theme is fundamentally his. Scroll down the website to see his website.

#### Q: Why is there an FAQ for a personal website repo?
